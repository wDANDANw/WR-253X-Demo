                    <hr />

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="large-8 push-2 columns">

                                However, why is it essential to increase the accessibility to techno-designs? Or what changes could the world envision that can be brought by increasing the accessibility of techno-designs?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The design justice framework proposed by Sasha Costanza-Chock (2020) provides some potential answers to this question (p.23).
                                In the proposed design justice framework, she first discussed how accessibility would grant diversity in the designer population in the book.
                                Then, she introduced evidence to prove that the diversity of designers could bring positive changes to the design, such as greater profits or better affordances (p.75-99).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, the game industry can be an excellent real-world subject to speculate potential changes on greater accessibility.
                                Game designers, who often do not have technical backgrounds, generally have difficulty conveying their designs to others because everyone may interpret the designer's design differently.
                                However, typically game designers will not be the developers who build up the interactable game. Consequently, the final game often forgets to include some critical, original, and fantastic ideas from the designers due to misinterpretations.
                                Imagine, what if designers can bring an intractable prototype that contains more sensical details, like visual details or sound details, to others when trying to convey their ideas?
                                We can speculate that the brilliant ideas that now have got forgotten or misinterpreted could be saved, and the final game will be more interesting.
                                Further, it can also reduce developers' efforts because they can build on existing prototypes rather than start from scratch.
                                This also helps reduce the loss of concepts during communications.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From a broader perspective, techno-design inherently will become more equal and just. With a lowered entrance, people can start to design right away rather than learning skills.
                                Then, with the mighty power of technology, people who initially have difficulty learning technology skills will be able to express their concepts in techno-designs.
                                With an increase in the population of designers, we can further expect that there will be a boom in brilliant designs.
                                Based on the above discussion, we can then draw the final vision of the practice manifesto: "greater accessibility will bring more brilliant designs."
