                    <hr />

                    <div class="row">

                        <div class="large-8 push-2 columns">
                            <p>
                                Ideally, in a perfect setting, the first assumption claims that one should always get some results after spending time on techno-designs.
                                However, at least in 2022, this is not the case. Certain groups of people have way greater access to techno-designs than other groups.
                                For example, designers with technical backgrounds can learn a new tool and start to design right away. In contrast, designers without technical backgrounds can only spend time learning before doing anything else.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Maybe some would argue that this is the nature of techno-designs: you ought to know more about technology if you want to utilize techno-designs.
                                However, before talking about this, we have to know that there is a difference between accessibility and usability. Accessibility is one's ability to reach or start with something.
                                It addresses the period before usage. On the other hand, usability is the easiness of using some functionalities. There is a fundamental difference between the two.
                                After clarifying this, we can truly see the problem: the entrance level for accessing techno-design is too high. Considering that design should be an activity that every human has equal access to, design derivatives should grant equal access to everyone.
                                Specific skills or knowledge, like technology, should be incremental skills that help you improve the design but not obstacles that prevent one from starting designing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Doodling is a perfect example to illustrate the concept of high accessibility here. People with no skills can convert their imaginations to drawings on paper without obstacles, though the sketch might be crude.
                                The essential thing is that everyone can start doodling without training. People with more advanced skills are still converting ideas to drawings, though they would be able to bring more details to the art.
                                Relate it to techno-designs: ideally, designers should be able to start techno-design as simple as doodling after paying a certain quantity of entry efforts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, due to the complexity of tools used in techno-designs, it is generally hard for people with no technology background to start techno-designs.
                                Worse, sometimes they even get nothing after spending hours learning it. Techno-designs are becoming a more professional and skilled thing to do now.
                                Therefore, I see that there is a need and necessity to make techno-designs more available to everyone by lowering the entrance level.
                                It then becomes the manifesto's double vision or core goal: "People with technology background should find means to lower the entrance level of techno-designs to ensure the accessibility of techno-designs."
